# Redux Practice

This is a project that I have done for practicing Redux. In this project I learned how to setup Redux on a React application so that the state of the app can be access from any component without having to use props

In this project, I created two state. One is to keep track of a counter and the other is to add an object of person to an array.

## Person State Structure

```[
    {
        name: "person name",
        age: person age
    }
]
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
